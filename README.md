## Project Overview

*"I want to look after myself and dress up for my own satisfaction, not just to appear pretty to others. I want to show that even though I can't see, it doesn't mean I can't do what I want,"* said a visually impaired woman.

For visually impaired individuals, the number of cosmetic products with Braille labels is extremely limited. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, less than 10% of the visually impaired population can use Braille. Most visually impaired people use smartphones to access information via voice.

We propose the **AI Cosmetic Guide App for Visually Impaired, Based on Watch**. This app uses a multi-turn dialogue system, where an AI makeup chatbot provides real-time guidance for selecting and applying makeup, ensuring the user selects the correct color for each step. 

The system includes a Watch-based haptic notification service that guides the user‚Äôs finger or brush to the right area by providing directional feedback when the user deviates from the correct spot.

- Communication with the Watch is facilitated through **Firebase Cloud**. The haptic motor in the Watch provides directional feedback based on the comparison between the finger's coordinates and the bounding box of the cosmetic product's class.
